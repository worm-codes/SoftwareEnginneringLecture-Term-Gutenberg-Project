Customized Visual Bookshelf from Gutenberg Project	
The aim of the project is to design and implement a user-friendly interface for searching books from Gutenberg project and collecting the chosen books in a visual bookshelf for a specific user of the system. Every user should see his own bookshelf when logs in and he should be able to change the books in his/her own shelf by making new searches. Or he/she can simply remove one book from his shelf if the book is finished. The system should also keep track of the point/page where the user paused reading.
Addition to the visualized bookshelf, a pop-up screen can be useful to show user which book is paused where.

What to do: Develop a web application (or a mobile one if you wish), which simulates his/her virtual bookshelf. 
The user should be able to search for a book, add the book to his/her bookshelf, open it to read and pause reading without losing the page he/she stopped. Every user should be able to log in/out to/from his/her own account. 

How to do: Apply one of the software development models and explain in detail why you choose the model. Also make the necessary documentation required in the model you choose.
Make a requirements engineering study for your project. Follow these steps:
•	Determine user requirements
•	Convert them to system requirements
•	Determine the system stakeholders
•	Determine functional requirements
•	Discuss about your requirements’ being complete and consistent
•	Determine non-functional requirements and classify them. Use some metrics if needed
•	State your usability requirements
•	Follow the requirements engineering process order (Elicitation, Analysis, Validation and Management)
•	What are your possible problems in these process steps? State and discuss solutions
•	Create your stories and user scenarios
•	Use structured specification for your requirements
•	Apply requirements checking
•	Do you foresee any changes in your system? If so, what do you plan to make changes?
•	Determine the system boundries in detail
•	Draw your state diagram
•	Draw and explain your architectural design

Methodology: Choose one of sw development methodologies, XP, Scrum or Kanban. The students will form project teams with 5 to 7 people for Scrum, 3 – 5 people for Kanban and 4 - 6 people for XP. During the semester, the project team will work together through the full development cycle, applying the principles of SCRUM, XP or Kanban, from understanding the requirements to delivering a functioning product, and making a series of presentation of the work to the client.
How to apply: Send an e-mail to Arş. Gör. Emre ŞATIR with the following information:
Team members’ IDs, Names and Surnames – Methodology chosen.
Project Due: 14.12.2021

During implementation phase, the teams should mind about the errors they get (syntax, logic and runtime errors, fatal errors, etc). They must classify the errors in groups.
